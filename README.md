# Employee Management System

This repository contains the Employee Management System, a Java-based application developed as a school project to showcase my Java programming skills. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes employee data across different companies, functioning as an HR catalog.

Features\
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Provides an intuitive interface for managing and viewing employee information.
Employee Records: Maintains detailed records of employees, including personal and professional details.
Company Categorization: Organizes employees by their respective companies for efficient data management.
Data Visualization: Displays employee data in tabular format, allowing for easy viewing and editing.

Technologies Used\
Java: Core programming language used for application development.
Swing: Utilized for building the graphical user interface.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Applied OOP principles for system design and implementation.

Learning Outcomes\
Through this project, I have demonstrated:

Java Proficiency: Developed a functional application using Java, showcasing understanding of the language.
GUI Development: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using Swing.
OOP Principles: Applied object-oriented design patterns for system organization and code reusability.
